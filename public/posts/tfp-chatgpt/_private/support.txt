The chart is conceptual, not built directly from raw BLS or Stanford AI Index data. 

The shape of the lines (TFP flattening, AI adoption skyrocketing) is historically accurate, 
but the exact percentages and scales are illustrative rather than pulled from real datasets.

Hereâ€™s the reality:

TFP data (accurate):

U.S. BLS shows strong growth through the 1950sâ€“60s, slowing around 1973.

Since ~2005, TFP growth has averaged ~0.5â€“1% per year â€” flat compared to earlier decades.

AI adoption data (accurate surveys):

McKinsey (2023): ~50% of companies report AI adoption in at least one business unit.

Stanford AI Index (2024): Generative AI adoption accelerated dramatically after 2022.

Before ~2015, adoption was effectively negligible.

So the story the chart tells is right, but the numbers in that mockup arenâ€™t from BLS spreadsheets or survey tables.

ðŸ‘‰ To be rigorously correct, I would need to pull real BLS TFP index data + McKinsey/Stanford adoption data, 
then build a precise chart with actual values and citations.
