For years, coding blogs followed a familiar pattern: a polished tutorial, fully working code, neat explanations. That style has its place , but today’s developer reality looks different. We live in an era of **vibe coding**, where AI is part of the toolkit from the first sketch of an idea.

At Signal & Syntax, I explore that new style:

- **Prompt → Output → Fix → Learn**
Posts aren’t static tutorials — they’re walkthroughs of how I use AI to explore solutions, refine them, and extract lessons along the way.
- **AI as a Force Multiplier**
I use modern LLMs to accelerate analysis, drafting, and prototyping — never as a substitute for human judgment.
- **Domain Knowledge First**
Real results come from understanding systems, users, and constraints — then encoding that context into prompts, tools, and evaluations.
- **Creativity with Constraints**
Every limitation is a design input. I model, simulate, and iterate with checkpoints to keep progress measurable.
- **Repeatability**
I favor reproducible workflows, versioned prompts, and test artifacts so insights can be shared, debugged, and built upon.

This lens shapes the posts you'll find here: hands-on guides, simulations,
annotated prompts, and tools that turn insight into working software.

This blog isn’t just about code. It’s about how we think, prompt, and build with AI in the loop.
