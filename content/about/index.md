I combine **AI**, **domain expertise**, and **creative problem-solving**
to build practical solutions.

- **AI as a force multiplier:** I use modern LLMs to accelerate analysis,
  drafting, and prototyping, never as a substitute for judgment.
- **Domain knowledge first:** Real results come from understanding the
  problem space (systems, users, constraints) and encoding that into prompts,
  tools, and evaluation.
- **Creativity with constraints:** I treat constraints as design inputs.
  I model the problem, simulate where useful, and iterate with measurable
  checkpoints.
- **Repeatability:** I favor reproducible workflows, versioned prompts,
  and test artifacts so ideas are sharable and debuggable.

This lens shapes the posts you'll find here: hands-on guides, simulations,
annotated prompts, and tools that turn insight into working software.
