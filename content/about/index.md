{{< aboutbio >}}

Tom helped build and run [CodeGuru.com](http://codeguru.com), once the web’s largest Windows developer community. He has been recognized by Microsoft as a C++ MVP and has written a dozen technical books and hundreds of online articles.

While very content in his current role at Microsoft, decades of experience have taught Tom that there's always tomorrow to plan for. If you have a cool and interesting project—especially one that blends technology, creativity, and real-world impact—he's always excited to hear about it!
